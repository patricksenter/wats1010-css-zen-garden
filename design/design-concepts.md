#Design Concepts

I'm going for a straightforward, basic design influenced loosely by Dave Shea's CSS Zen Garden design (http://csszengarden.com/215/). I wanted the user to read through the page content without seeing it all as one giant article. I wanted to emphasize that it's broken up in different pieces and I think the concept of using two half-sized columns next to each other with broken up by larger columns achieves just that.I

All of the major links and archive stuff will go in the footer. Additionally I'm considering making it a fixed element depending on how small or large it ends up being.All
